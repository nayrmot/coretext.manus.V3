## Current Status
As of April 20, 2025, we have completed Phase 1: Database Implementation & Case Selection. The MongoDB integration is working correctly, and the case-centric workflow has been implemented. Users can now select cases from a global selector, view case details, and filter cases based on various criteria.

## Next Steps
The next phase (Phase 2) will focus on document upload and management. This will include implementing the document data model, creating a file storage system, developing the document upload interface, and adding basic document management features.

## Technical Notes
- MongoDB is used as the primary database
- The application is built using Node.js for the backend
- The frontend uses HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript
- Bootstrap is used for UI components
- The application is designed to be deployed on Google Cloud Platform
