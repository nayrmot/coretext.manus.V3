I'm continuing work on the CoreText document management application from the GitHub repository at https://github.com/nayrmot/coretext.manus.V3. We've successfully completed Phase 1 (MongoDB Integration & Case Selection) and are now ready to begin Phase 2: Document Upload & Management.

In Phase 1, we:
1. Set up MongoDB integration with proper connection handling
2. Implemented the case data model and controller
3. Created API endpoints for case management (both authenticated and public routes)
4. Implemented a global case selector that persists across the application
5. Added case filtering and search capabilities
6. Created test pages to verify the implementation
7. Fixed critical issues with case creation functionality
8. Implemented conditional imports to handle missing modules gracefully
9. Created a comprehensive implementation summary (CoreText_Implementation_Summary.md)

The MongoDB connection is working correctly, and we've successfully created and retrieved sample cases. All API tests are now passing, including database connection, case retrieval, and case creation. The most recent fixes addressed:
- The "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')" error in case creation
- The "MODULE_NOT_FOUND" error for missing user.routes.js
- API endpoint configuration issues between client and server

For Phase 2, we need to implement document upload and management functionality, including:
1. Document data model implementation
2. File storage system setup (local or cloud-based)
3. Document upload interface development
4. Document categorization implementation
5. Document versioning
6. Document preview functionality
7. Basic document search capabilities

The document upload interface should integrate with the existing case-centric workflow, where documents are associated with specific cases and the global case selector determines the context for document operations.

Please review the repository, particularly the CoreText_Implementation_Summary.md file, to understand our detailed progress and help implement Phase 2 of the project. The repository contains all the code from Phase 1, including the MongoDB integration, case selection functionality, and recent fixes for robust error handling.
