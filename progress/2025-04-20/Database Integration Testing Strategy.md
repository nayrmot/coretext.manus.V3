| Create Case | 1. Fill out all required fields<br>2. Submit form | - Case is created in database<br>- Success message is displayed<br>- User is redirected to case listing page |
| Reset Form | 1. Fill out some fields<br>2. Click "Reset" button | - All form fields are cleared<br>- Validation errors are removed |
| Cancel Creation | 1. Fill out some fields<br>2. Click "Cancel" button | - User is redirected to case listing page<br>- No case is created |

### 2.3 Global Case Selector

| Test Scenario | Steps | Expected Result |
|---------------|-------|-----------------|
| Initial Load | 1. Load any page with the navigation bar<br>2. Wait for selector to load | - Cases are fetched from database<br>- Cases are added to selector<br>- Previously selected case is highlighted |
| Select Case | 1. Select a case from the dropdown | - User is navigated to the selected case page<br>- Selected case is saved to localStorage |
| Create New Case | 1. Select "New Case" option | - User is navigated to case creation page |

## 3. End-to-End Testing

### 3.1 Complete Workflows

| Workflow | Steps | Expected Result |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| Create and View Case | 1. Navigate to case creation page<br>2. Create a new case<br>3. View the case in the listing<br>4. Select the case from global selector | - Case is created successfully<br>- Case appears in the listing<br>- Case can be selected from global selector<br>- Case details are displayed correctly |
| Filter and Paginate | 1. Navigate to case listing page<br>2. Apply filters<br>3. Navigate through pages<br>4. Clear filters | - Filtered cases are displayed correctly<br>- Pagination works with filters applied<br>- Clearing filters shows all cases again |
| Update and Delete | 1. Navigate to case listing page<br>2. Edit a case<br>3. Save changes<br>4. Delete the case | - Case is updated successfully<br>- Updated case appears in the listing<br>- Case is deleted successfully<br>- Case is removed from the listing |

### 3.2 Error Handling

| Scenario | Steps | Expected Result |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| Server Unavailable | 1. Stop the server<br>2. Try to load cases<br>3. Try to create a case | - Appropriate error messages are displayed<br>- UI remains functional<br>- User can retry operations |
| Database Connection Error | 1. Disconnect database<br>2. Try to load cases<br>3. Try to create a case | - Appropriate error messages are displayed<br>- UI remains functional<br>- User can retry operations |
| Invalid Data | 1. Try to create a case with invalid data<br>2. Try to update a case with invalid data | - Validation errors are displayed<br>- Invalid operations are prevented |

## 4. Performance Testing

| Test | Description | Acceptance Criteria |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| Case Listing Load Time | Measure time to load and display cases | < 2 seconds for 100 cases |
| Case Creation Response Time | Measure time from submission to confirmation | < 1 second |
| Filter Response Time | Measure time to apply filters and display results | < 1 second |
| Global Selector Load Time | Measure time to load and populate selector | < 1 second |

## 5. Cross-Browser Testing

Test all functionality in the following browsers:

- Google Chrome (latest)
- Mozilla Firefox (latest)
- Microsoft Edge (latest)
- Safari (latest, if available)

## 6. Mobile Responsiveness Testing

Test all functionality on the following device types:

- Desktop (1920x1080)
- Tablet (768x1024)
- Mobile (375x667)

## 7. Testing Tools

### 7.1 Manual Testing

- Browser Developer Tools for debugging
- Network tab for monitoring API requests
- Console for JavaScript errors
- Application tab for localStorage inspection

### 7.2 Automated Testing (Future Implementation)

- Jest for JavaScript unit testing
- Cypress for end-to-end testing
- Lighthouse for performance testing

## 8. Testing Process

### 8.1 Pre-Integration Testing

1. Verify all JavaScript files are correctly implemented
2. Verify all API endpoints are working correctly
3. Verify MongoDB connection is working

### 8.2 Integration Testing

1. Update HTML files according to implementation steps
2. Test each component individually
3. Test components working together
4. Verify all test cases pass

### 8.3 Regression Testing

1. Verify existing functionality still works
2. Verify no new bugs are introduced
3. Verify performance is acceptable

## 9. Test Documentation

For each test case, document:

1. Test case ID and description
2. Steps to reproduce
3. Expected result
4. Actual result
5. Pass/Fail status
6. Any issues or notes

## 10. Issue Tracking

For any issues found during testing:

1. Document the issue with steps to reproduce
2. Assign priority (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
3. Fix the issue
4. Retest to verify the fix
5. Update documentation

## Conclusion

Following this testing strategy will ensure that the database integration components of the CoreText Document Management System work correctly and reliably. Once all tests pass, Phase 1 will be complete and the system will be ready for Phase 2: Document Upload & Management.
