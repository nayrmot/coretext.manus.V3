I'm continuing work on the CoreText document management application from the GitHub repository at https://github.com/nayrmot/coretext.manus.V3. We've successfully completed Phase 1 (MongoDB Integration & Case Selection) and are now ready to begin Phase 2: Document Upload & Management.

In Phase 1, we:
1. Set up MongoDB integration with proper connection handling
2. Implemented the case data model and controller
3. Created API endpoints for case management
4. Implemented a global case selector that persists across the application
5. Added case filtering and search capabilities
6. Created test pages to verify the implementation

The MongoDB connection is working correctly, and we've successfully created and retrieved sample cases. The UI now displays the cases properly and allows for case selection.

For Phase 2, we need to implement document upload and management functionality, including:
1. Document data model implementation
2. File storage system setup (local or cloud-based)
3. Document upload interface development
4. Document categorization implementation
5. Document versioning
6. Document preview functionality
7. Basic document search capabilities

Please review the repository, particularly the updated ROADMAP.md file, to understand our progress and help implement Phase 2 of the project. The repository contains all the code from Phase 1, including the MongoDB integration and case selection functionality.
